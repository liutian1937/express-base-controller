I for one truly love to separate different parts of my code, so adding dedicated controller classes was the first thing i did when playing around with the express framework for nodejs. It is not at all a fancy implementation that tries to reimplement big frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Django, but rather a small script that provides what I need at the moment.

Usage is really simple:

* Create a new express app
	 express --sessions application-name
* Checkout express-base-controller into your expressjs app folder
* Add the following line to your app.js
	 require('./express-base-controller/base_controller.js').init_routes(app);
	
Thats more or less it. After starting your app using 'node app.js' you should be able to access the example controller's index action using http://localhost:3000/example-controller and the test action using http://localhost:3000/example-controller/test.

To write your own controllers simply add them to express-base-controller/controllers.

The main idea was outlined at http://roman-weinberger.net/blog/adding-rails-style-controllers-to-the-express-framework-for-node-js/
